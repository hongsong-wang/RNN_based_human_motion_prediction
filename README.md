# RNN_based_human_motion_prediction 

Forecasting human motion from a sequence of 3D poses is an important problem in the fields of computer vision and robotics. Sequence-to-sequence learning approaches have been applied to human motion prediction, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Transformer.

This project is for RNN based methods for human motion prediction, especially the full code of our two papers [1, 2].
